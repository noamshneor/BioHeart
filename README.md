# A software for analyzing heart rate signals
BioHeart software was built as part of the degree's final project.
<p>This project deals with the characterization and development of a tool for analyzing physiological signals produced using the BIOPAC device. The BIOPAC instrument is used for research purposes in order to monitor the experimenter's responses and physiological indices at the various experimental stages. The device measures the PPG blood volume, from which it is possible to deduce the variance of the heart rate - HRV and the heart rate - HR.</p>
<p>The purpose of the project is to assist research in the driving simulator laboratory in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management at Ben-Gurion University. This project will allow an objective measurement of pressure on the subjects while driving the simulator, using heart rate signals. There is a real need for this project because today the data of the physiological signals collected from the BIOPAC device are raw data, from which it is not possible to deduce the condition of the subject at the various stages of the experiment. That is, before the project was realized, the raw data was sent to external parties in order to process them and derive findings from them. The programming tool built in this project performs analysis and processing of the physiological signals measured using the BIOPAC device thus avoiding the need to send the raw data for external processing, and will assist in studies performed in the department using the device. This programming tool is an adaptive tool that supports different types of experiments (number of trips, events, groups and subjects, uniquely adapted to the experiment).</p>
<p>This project is a programming tool development that deals with data analysis. The tool will provide the experimenter (user) with an analysis of four different statistical indices (PNN50, RMSSD, SDSD, SDNN) to analyze the heart rate variance as well as the average heart rate. The results of the analysis will include an index value for each experimenter in each event in which he participated during the experiment and will also allow the user to see the data quality indices for each index. In addition, it possible to check whether abnormal metrics have been obtained and extract them from the analysis, and also displays the data visually by unique graphs of the user's choice. The project met its objectives, as the programming tool contains the defined requirements.</p>
<p>In order to build a tool that would fit the requirements of the project, it was decided to program the tool in <b>Python</b>. Also, in order to verify the programming tool, we performed a manual analysis of two experiments performed in the simulator lab and compared the results against the software output.</p>
<p>The main steps in carrying out the project were: getting acquainted with the physiological indices, comparing programming languages and choosing the programming language appropriate to the project requirements, getting to know and choosing methods for analyzing the physiological indices, tool design (GUI) and programming, tool validation and building user guides.</p>
<p>The project's achievements are adaptive programming tools, suitable for a large number of experiments performed in the driving simulator laboratory, which performs heart rate analysis and four HRV indices for each experimenter in the various experimental stages, and presents the results in a table and graphs. Also, the tool is adapted for users without a programming background.</p>
